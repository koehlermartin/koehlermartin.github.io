      <description>&lt;p&gt;@neurIST- Integrated Biomedical Informatics for the Management of Cerebral Aneurysms - is a European initiative within the Sixth Framework Programme Priority 2 of the Information Society Technologies IST. This 4-year project started in January 1st 2006 and finished the 31st of March 2010 with a 17 million â‚¬ budget, gathering 28 public and private institutions of 12 European countries. Several organizations from the U.S.A., New Zealand and Japan participate as external collaborators. @neurIST partners include industrial, medical and academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@neurIST is focussed on cerebral aneurysms and provides an integrated decision support system to assess the risk of aneurysm rupture in patients and to optimize their treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@neurIST believes that the current process of cerebral aneurysm diagnosis, treatment planning and treatment development is highly compromised by the fragmentation of relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@neurIST presents a new paradigm to understand and manage cerebral aneurysms. A complete IT infrastructure has been developeded for the management and processing of the vast amount of heterogeneous data acquired during diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@neurIST benefits patients with better diagnostics, prevention and treatment because it combines efforts of clinicians and industry. Through research clinicians gain a greater insight in aneurysm understanding, while industry will be dragged by these achievements to develop more suitable medical devices to treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
